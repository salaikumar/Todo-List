# Todo-List
Repo to serve as Todo List for me.
Basically I'm bored with the list of To do apps out there. So, I',m going to use this README as my TODO.

## Revise Basics and Problem Solving.
I would like to revisit my basics and Problem Solving skills. So, this time, I would follow a proper approach to track my progress. These works would begin from February. All the other works are shifted to a latter, since I feel this is of little higher priority.

Estimated Time Period : Feb to March.
Target : Solve at least 50-100 Interview problems. (Algorithms + Design)
1. Cracking the Coding Interview 
2. Elements of Programming Interview Exposed
